Software implementation of the paper [Learning representations of multivariate time series with missing data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2019.106973).

The proposed approach allows to learn representations of real valued time series with missing data by means of an autoencoder regularized with TCK, the [Time series Cluster Kernel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320317304843).
