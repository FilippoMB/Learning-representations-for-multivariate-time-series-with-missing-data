Software implementation of the architecture presented in the paper [Learning representations of multivariate time series with missing data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03473) by [F. M. Bianchi](https://sites.google.com/view/filippombianchi/home) et al.

## TL;DR
The proposed approach allows for learning representations of real-valued time series with missing data by means of an autoencoder (AE) regularized by the [Time series Cluster Kernel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320317304843) (TCK).
In particular, the inner products of the vectorial representations generated by the AE are aligned with the entries of TCK.
